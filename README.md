# doubly-linked-list
## Introduction
I believe that anyone who codes in Java will eventually encounter a linked list. It's simple to use; Java already provides interfaces for us. However, despite my frequent use of it, I still lack a thorough understanding of its internal workings. Therefore, in this blog, I will delve deeply into the implementation of Linked List, its pros and cons, and other related topics. I hope this blog could be beneficial to someone who is looking to learn about LinkedIn as well.


## LinkedList vs String[]
When managing collections of data in Java, choosing the right data structure is crucial for efficient performance and flexibility. Here, we compare LinkedList<String> with String[] to illustrate when and why you might prefer using a linked list over an array of strings:

| Feature / Consideration     | `String[]` (Array of Strings)                 | `LinkedList<String>` (Linked List of Strings)                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fixed Size**              | Yes                                           | No                                                                      |
| **Random Access**           | Yes (by index)                                | No (sequential access required for traversal)                           |
| **Memory Efficiency**       | More memory-efficient (contiguous storage)    | Less memory-efficient (uses more memory due to node overhead)           |
| **Insertions and Deletions**| Slower for large arrays (shift elements)      | Faster (adjusts references, no need to shift elements)                  |
| **Dynamic Size**            | No                                            | Yes                                                                     |
| **Performance Considerations** | Efficient for random access operations     | Efficient for frequent insertions/deletions and iteration operations     |

### Key Points of Comparison:

- **Fixed vs. Dynamic Size:**
  - `String[]`: Suitable when the number of elements is constant.
  - `LinkedList<String>`: Ideal for collections with varying sizes.

- **Access Patterns:**
  - `String[]`: Efficient for random access using indices.
  - `LinkedList<String>`: Efficient for sequential access and frequent insertions/deletions.

- **Memory Usage:**
  - `String[]`: More memory-efficient due to contiguous storage.
  - `LinkedList<String>`: Uses more memory due to node overhead.

### Conclusion

Choose `String[]` for fixed-size collections requiring efficient random access. Opt for `LinkedList<String>` when flexibility in size and efficient insertions/deletions are needed. Understanding these differences helps optimize performance and scalability in Java applications.
