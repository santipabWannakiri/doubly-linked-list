# doubly-linked-list
## Introduction
I believe that anyone who codes in Java will eventually encounter a linked list. It's simple to use; Java already provides interfaces for us. However, despite my frequent use of it, I still lack a thorough understanding of its internal workings. Therefore, in this blog, I will delve deeply into the implementation of Linked List, its pros and cons, and other related topics. I hope this blog could be beneficial to someone who is looking to learn about LinkedIn as well.


## LinkedList vs String[]
When managing collections of data in Java, choosing the right data structure is crucial for efficient performance and flexibility. Here, we compare LinkedList<String> with String[] to illustrate when and why you might prefer using a linked list over an array of strings:

String[] vs LinkedList
Doubly vs Singly
head = left , tail = right ?
Big O, Best case, Worst, Average
